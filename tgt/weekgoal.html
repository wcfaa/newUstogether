	<hr>

	<p>These are some of the things to complete this week.</p>

<p>1. Building the login system. Information required: ITSC, Username, Password.<br />

3. Design the header page. Red background color. Font Color: White or Greyish.<br />
 Features include:<br />
 a)Newly Created Groups(What's New)<br />
 b)About Us<br />
 c)Sign Up<br />
 d)Sign In<br />
4. Implement the slider function. <br />
5. Banner Picture Selection for slider, rough size:1280*400~800, 3 pieces<br />
5. Banner Slogan<br />
6. Content Picture Selection, rough size:600*400, 6 pieces<br />
7. Confirm the ER diagram</p>

<p>Thomas, for your information, the design we are adopting is the one presented by meetup.com or coursera.org. You can think about some powerful slogans to put up on the slider this week and try to come up with features you want to put in our website. Also, you may need to watch some tutorials to pick up the basics of html5 and css and I will revise that too.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br />
Lorraine</p>
